    <p>
      My journey into the world of Content Writing began in high school, when I took my first internship. I was fascinated by the creativity I could put into writing, but I also craved a technical outlet. This led me to take Data Science as my engineering major.

      I quickly realized that I didn't have to choose between my two passions. Instead, I could combine them. That's why here I am, continuously exploring and challenging my skills.

      I am passionate about leveraging data to tell compelling stories, and with my professional experience as a content writer, I have honed my ability to craft engaging narratives and communicate complex ideas effectively.
